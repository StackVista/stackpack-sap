## Prerequisites

To set up the StackState SAP integration, you need to have:

- A running SAP instance.
- [StackState Agent V2](/#/stackpacks/stackstate-agent-v2/) installed on a machine that can connect to both your SAP instance and StackState.

For full details of the SAP integration, including the data retrieved, see the [SAP StackPack documentation \(docs.stackstate.com\)](https://l.stackstate.com/ui-sap-stackpack-docs).
